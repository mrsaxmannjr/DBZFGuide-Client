The Reader is the main feature of Readativity.  Once the user clicks "Start Reading", they will be instantly served an article that is pulled from the Google News API based on their 3 interests.  The User also has access to the "New Article" button which will randomly serve up another article based on the user's interests.

## Stats:
The Stats page will display the user's reading statistics on 2 graphs.  The "Time Reading this Week" graph is a line graph that plots the user's total minutes spent reading per day across the span of a week.  "Time Reading by Interest" is a radial graph that plots the minutes spent reading each by interest.  In addition, the user can check their "Article History".
