## Team Builder
Using the Team Builder, you can browse the character roster and character stats and then add 3 FighterZ to your custom team. Here you can give your team a name, a team description and record the team's battle record. If you want to edit or update your team's information, just head over to Saved TeamZ and any changes will be saved to that team.
