              <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>To punish a Super Dash you can press Down + Heavy Attack with precise timing</li>
                <li>Super Dash will go through most projectile attacks that are not super moves or command special moves</li>
                <li>Most jumping attacks need to be blocked from a standing position. If you crouch you will get hit</li>
                <li>Use Vanish to punish raw super moves used outside of a combo. You can perform a Vanish during the starting animation of a super move</li>
                <li>Forward + Medium Attack is a universal overhead attack for all characters</li>
                <li>You can call certain assists to extend combos or cover your Super Dash approach, making it hard to punish</li>

              <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic Controls</h6></div>
            <div class="white-text collapsible-body">
              <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Light Attack</li>
                <li>Medium Attack</li>
                <li>Heavy Attack</li>
                <li>Special Attack (Ki Blasts)</li>
                <li>Assist 1</li>
                <li>Assist 2</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Dragon Ball FighterZ is a six button fighting game. There’s a Light Attack, Medium Attack, Heavy Attack, Special Attack (Ki blasts), and buttons for Assist 1 and Assist 2. You can chain Light Attacks into Medium Attacks into Heavy Attacks, call
                assists by tapping Assist 1 or Assist 2, or change characters by holding Assist 1 or Assist 2.</p>
              <p>
                While the buttons listed above are set as default to your controller, you can customize your button configuration as you see fit. Dragon Rush and Super Dash macros are set to the right shoulder buttons by default as well. In addition, you can assign
                buttons to Ki Charge, Vanish and Sparking Blast instead of having to manually press multiple buttons as once.</p>
              <p>
                Finally, crouching Heavy Attack (Down + Heavy Attack) also serves as a universal anti-air attack, which gives your character invincibility to their upper body. This works well as an anti-air attack, and to punish any opponent who is abusing the Super
                Dash mechanic.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>

              <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3-on-3 Combat</h6></div>
            <div class="white-text collapsible-body">
              <p>One of the biggest ways that Dragon Ball FighterZ differentiates itself from the combat featured in the Xenoverse games is that it offers 3 vs. 3 battles in a style closer to Marvel vs. Capcom. In Xenoverse you could pick multiple characters and
                switch between them on the fly while battling in large 3D environments. FighterZ takes a more traditional approach by offering 1-on-1 combat with two assist characters.</p>
              <p>If you’ve played the last two games in the Marvel vs. Capcom series, you already have a general idea of how this works. You select three characters, then head into battle. Your first character is the point character, while the other two take up
                assist roles. As you battle 1-on-1 against your opponent’s point character, you can call the other two characters to quickly move in and perform an attack.</p>
              <p>While you can quickly tag in one of your assists to become your point character, if one character gets KO’d, there’s a short cinematic that plays with your next character making a dramatic entrance to continue the fight. Just like in Marvel vs.
                Capcom, if you lose one character, the next character in line jumps in to take over.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="yellow accent-4 collapsible-header z-depth-5">
              <img id="dballz" src="/Assets/Dragon_Balls_.png" alt="">
              <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Composition</h6></div>
            <div class="white-text collapsible-body">
              <p>Your team composition and order are important in Dragon Ball FighterZ. Every character can only use one tag in super move, and different characters excel at different aspects of the game, which means you need to know when to tag in with a super
                move, when to simply continue a combo with a single character, and when to tag in another character to continue the combo without immediately transitioning into a super move.</p>
              <p>While this may seem complex at first, once you’ve played the game enough you will start to understand that some characters are better to initiate a combo (Trunks), but have difficulty ending the combo with a lot of damage. In these instances it’s
                better to tag into another character who can finish a combo with a ton of damage (Android 16) or just keep the combo going much better than your point character that started the combo.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="yellow accent-4 collapsible-header z-depth-5">
              <img id="dballz" src="/Assets/Dragon_Balls_.png" alt="">
              <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assits</h6></div>
            <div class="white-text collapsible-body">
              <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Assist 1</li>
                <li>Assist 2</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Each character has one assist which you can activate by tapping the Assist 1 or Assist 2 button. When you’re selecting a character it’s important to not only think about how the character plays, but also what that character’s assist is. Some
                assists will be vertical beams, others might be an anti-air attack, while some fall into completely different categories, such as Krillin’s senzu bean assist.</p>
              <p>
                You have two assist buttons, one for each character who is currently tagged out. Different assists will have different cooldown periods, meaning you need to determine how important each assist is because you won’t be able to simply call them over and
                over again throughout the match. The background of a character’s icon in the upper left or right corner of the screen indicates when an assist is ready to use, or how long you need to wait until an assist can be used again.</p>
              <p>
                While you can call both assists at once if you so desire, in addition to the cooldown period that will follow, both assists can be hit by an opponent. Even if you only call one assist, it can still be attacked by an opponent so be careful when and
                how you call your assists to make sure they don’t take damage.</p>

              <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Super Moves</h6></div>
            <div class="white-text collapsible-body">
              <p>Each character has a variety of super moves that can take as many as seven bars of super meter (the meter at the bottom of the screen). Most super moves will consume one or three bars of meter, but there are some exceptions. Most super moves are
                performed by inputting the notation for a special move and pressing two attack buttons instead of one.</p>
              <p>You can tag in a teammate by pressing Assist 1 or Assist 2 during a super move. This causes that teammate to come in with a super move of their own and possibly extend your combo. In the latest build of the game, using a super move at the end of
                most combos didn’t inflict that much damage. Depending on your team composition and combo ability, it may be better to save your super meter for other things.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="yellow accent-4 collapsible-header z-depth-5">
              <img id="dballz" src="/Assets/Dragon_Balls_.png" alt="">
              <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Super Meter</h6></div>
            <div class="white-text collapsible-body">
              <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Hold Light Attack + Special Attack to Charge</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Your super meter fills up when you hit the opponent or perform special moves. You can also fill the super meter manually by holding Light Attack + Special Attack. The longer you hold these buttons the faster your super meter will charge, but you
                are completely open to attacks while doing this, so be careful.</p>
              <p>
                In addition to super moves using up your super meter, EX specials are enhanced special moves performed with the Heavy Attack button, which cost one bar of the super meter. Vanish Attacks also cost one bar of super meter, but can allow you to punish
                opponents from across the screen and more. Performing a character change (hold the Assist 1 or Assist 2 button) while blocking an attack also costs one bar of super meter.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>

              <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragon Rush (Throw)</h6></div>
            <div class="white-text collapsible-body">
              <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Light Attack + Medium Attack</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The Dragon Rush attack is basically how you perform a throw in Dragon Ball FighterZ. Press Light Attack + Medium Attack and your character will dash toward the opponent and perform a throw, which cannot be blocked in most situations. You can then
                transition directly into a combo if the Dragon Rush is successful. After a successful Dragon Rush, you can also force your opponent’s character to tag out, bringing in the next character on their team. This can be very useful if the opponent’s next
                character has low health and you want to finish them off before they replenish any blue health.</p>
              <p>
                You can escape a Dragon Rush but pressing Light Attack + Medium Attack just as the opponent’s Dragon Rush makes contact with your character. The timing can be somewhat strict, but as long as you pay close attention to the opponent, you can break out
                of the Dragon Rush just as it connects. Look for a red circle to flash around the opponent. This happens just before an opponent dashes in for a Dragon Rush.</p>
            </div>

              <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Super Dash</h6></div>
            <div class="white-text collapsible-body">
              <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Heavy Attack + Special Attack</li>
              </ul>
              <p>A Super Dash is a homing attack that tracks the opponent and allows you to close in on them quickly. In addition, a Super Dash goes through most projectile attacks (not super moves of special Ki blasts like a Kamehameha), meaning you can Super
                Dash right through a Ki blast barrage or even some special attacks with proper timing. However, keep in mind a Super Dash can be deflected and countered using the Deflect ability, a super move, or even a basic crouching Heavy Attack. When you tag in
                a character by holding down Assist 1 or Assist 2, they come in with a Super Dash which can also be countered just like a normal Super Dash.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="yellow accent-4 collapsible-header z-depth-5">

              <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanish (Teleport Attack)</h6></div>
            <div class="white-text collapsible-body">
              <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Medium Attack + Heavy Attack</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you’ve played almost any other Dragon Ball fighting game, you’re probably familiar with Vanish Attacks. In Dragon Ball FighterZ, Vanish Attacks cost one bar of super meter and cause a wall bounce, which you can follow with a Super Dash into a
                combo. You can even cancel into a Vanish Attack mid combo to extend your combo even further. Ideally you want to either save your Vanish for a combo extension, or use it when an opponent tries to attack with a raw super move from across the screen,
                or even just a barrage of Ki blasts. In some situations you can follow a raw Vanish with a full combo, especially if you have an assist character that can reach far enough to connect after a Vanish.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="yellow accent-4 collapsible-header z-depth-5">
              <img id="dballz" src="/Assets/Dragon_Balls_.png" alt="">
              <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ki Blasts</h6></div>
            <div class="white-text collapsible-body">
              <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Special Attack</li>
              </ul>
              <p>There’s a single button (Special Attack) that’s dedicated to Ki Blasts and similar attacks. You can rapidly press this button and most characters will throw out a barrage of Ki Blasts, just like in the anime. However, keep in mind these Ki Blasts
                can be deflected by a skilled opponent if they press Back + Special Attack with proper timing. An opponent can also Super Dash through your Ki Blasts, so be careful when you use them. You shouldn’t rely on this mechanic to inflict a lot of damage,
                but more so to annoy an opponent from across the screen. Most characters have special command Ki Blasts that require some sort of notation ending with the Special Attack button. For example, if Krillin presses Down + Special Attack, he will jump in
                the air and fire a Ki Blast down toward the ground.</p>
            </div>
          </li>

                <li>Back + Special Attack</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can deflect Ki Blasts and certain other attacks by pressing Back + Special Attack. The timing can be strict depending on what attack you’re trying to deflect. If you’re just deflecting random Ki blasts, it shouldn’t take much practice to get
                the deflect timing down. However, if you’re trying to deflect beam super moves or other more complex attacks, the timing may be more strict. You can also only deflect while your character is in a standing position. You can’t deflect which crouching
                or while in the air, which means you cannot deflect attacks that hit low. After a successful deflect, you can sometimes follow with a combo if you're close enough to the opponent.

              <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smash Attacks</h6></div>
            <div class="white-text collapsible-body">
              <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Heavy Attack</li>
                <li>Down + Heavy Attack</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Smash Attacks are basically the Heavy Attacks that are generally used to extend combos. If you press Down + Heavy Attack you can launch an opponent into the air, then follow with a combo. Pressing Heavy Attack with no direction will knock an
                opponent to the wall and allow you to follow with a combo. You can press Heavy Attack after a Smash Attack to follow the opponent and start a combo. However, you can only use one Smash Attack to continue a combo. If you try to use a second Smash
                Attack in the same combo it will effectively end the combo by slamming the opponent to the ground or some similar animation.
              </p>
              <p>If you use a down Smash, then hold Assist 1 or Assist 2, or Forward + Assist 1 or 2, most characters (not all) will tag in one of their partners to continue the combo. This is a great way to switch characters so you can end a combo with big
                damage, or just safely bring in another character. For example, let’s say you really like playing with Vegeta, but you can get more damage if you end combos with Goku. You can start a combo, then use a down Smash and tag in Vegeta to end the combo
                with a barrage of attacks into a super move, then use a second super move to bring Vegeta back in.</p>

              <p>The main comeback mechanic in Dragon Ball FighterZ is the Sparking Blast. If you perform it near an opponent, the opponent will get knocked back. However, if you use it in the middle of your combo, you can continue the combo afterward. While
                Sparking Blast is active, your character recovers all blue health over a short period of time. In addition, your attack damage is slightly increased to make it easier to defeat your opponent. Keep in mind, Sparking Blast only has an impact on the
                character who is currently in the match, not your two assist characters.
              </p>
              <p>How long Sparking Blast is active depends on how many characters are still alive on your team. If only a single character is alive when you activate Sparking Blast, it lasts much longer compared to having all three characters alive when you
                activate it. In most cases you want to save Sparking Blast for your last remaining character, but don’t hold onto it so long that you end up losing before you can use it.</p>

              <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to Summon Shenron</h6></div>
            <div class="white-text collapsible-body">
              <p>By performing specific combos during a match, players will get a single Dragon Ball. At the moment, this is based on auto combos or performing a specific numbers of hits in a combo. For example a 10-hit combo would give you the one star Dragon
                Ball. Likewise, a 70-hit combo would give you the seven star Dragon Ball. As you perform these combos you will earn Dragon Balls.</p>
              <p>
                It doesn’t matter which player collects the Dragon Balls, or what order they’re collected in. What does matter is who collects the final Dragon Ball. Once six Dragon Balls have been collected, the player who obtains the seventh Dragon Ball will be
                the one who summons Shenron. Even if the last Dragon Ball is the only one that player collected, they will still be the one and only player who will summon Shenron.</p>
              <p>
                Once summoned, Shenron will grant you one of four wishes that you can choose. You can have Shenron heal the current point character to full health, revive a fallen teammate with 20 percent health, add a second Sparking Blast icon (so you can use the
                ability twice in the match), or regenerate all blue health for your entire team. The wish you select should depend on the current state of the fight. If you only have one team member left, you may want to revive a fallen teammate. If you have all
                three team members, and lots of blue health, you may want to regenerate all blue health.</p>
